# C-project-boilerplate
When I was studying at 42 I was tired of setting up every time same header makefiles for every project. Also when I write code at home and come to campus
I got weird compiling issue, library inconsistencies etc.

Therefore I'm creating this repo for future students who is facing same problem.
